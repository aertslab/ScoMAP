# ScoMAP

## What is ScoMAP?

ScoMAP (ScoMAP: Single-Cell Omics Mapping into spatial Axes using Pseudospatial ordering) is an R package to spatially integrate single-cell omics data into virtual cells. These virtual cells may be organized in a template that resembles the tissue (e.g. such as the Drosophila's eye-antennal disc), or into an abstract space (e.g. when cell types are not spatially located). ScoMAP also includes functionalities to derive enhancer-to-gene relationships from the virtual template when mapping both single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data into the virtual cells.
